The Internet of Things (IoT) facilitates the interconnection and data exchange of modern objects across every aspect of our lives, including our homes, cars, and even our bodies. By 2025, forecasts suggest that there will be more than 75 billion Internet of Things (IoT) connected devices in use. However, due to the open nature of Internet connectivity, IoT brings a big challenge for the security community; hackers may exploit critical vulnerabilities in a wide range of IoT applications and devices for carrying out their nefarious activities. As a result, IoT security has already become an issue of high concern. Undoubtedly, in terms of offensive security, there is an urgent need to understand IoT-related attacks. This will help toward designing the appropriate security mechanisms.
This special issue focuses on IoT-related attacks and defences, and aims to solicit original research papers that discuss novel ways in compromising and protecting IoT networks and devices. We would like to cordially invite you to participate in this special issue by submitting your current research results within a research article or a short communication. Review articles are also considered provided that the topic of the review is discussed in advance.
