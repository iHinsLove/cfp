# Call for Papers

### Overview

With the rapid development of Internet-of-Things (IoT), more smart devices can be connected to the Internet, resulting in a dramatic increase of data transmission and communication. **Software-Defined Networking (SDN)**, which separates the control planes and data planes, is considered as a promising solution to provide the scale and versatility necessary for IoT. However, there are still many security issues that need to be addressed in this network architecture before the widespread adoption of SDN.**SISDN** set a goal to become a premier symposium and an international forum for presentation and discussion of cutting-edge research in SDN security.
