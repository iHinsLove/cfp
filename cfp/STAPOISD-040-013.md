## Call for Papers

The Internet of Things can bring huge economic opportunities to all walks of life, and can support exciting innovations in various fields, including child care, elderly care, healthcare, energy, manufacturing, and transportation.

Technical experts and analysts predict that in the future, IoT devices and applications will be more widely used and devices, services, and applications involving the IoT field will also continue to develop. Therefore, organizations are often eager to take advantage of these business advantages. However, due to very real IoT security issues, many companies are right to be cautious when pursuing the benefits of IoT solutions. IoT deployments expose global enterprises to new and unique security, privacy, and compliance challenges.

Although IoT devices may seem inconspicuous or too professional to be dangerous, general-purpose computers that are actually connected to the Internet have real risks. They may be hijacked by attackers and cause problems beyond IoT security. Even the most common devices that are compromised via the Internet can become dangerous, including surveillance of baby video monitors and interruptions in service to life-saving medical devices. Once attackers have control, they can steal data, disrupt service delivery, or use computers to commit any other cybercrime. Attacks that endanger the IoT infrastructure will not only cause data leakage and operational unreliability, but also cause physical damage to the facility, or worse, to the personnel operating or relying on these facilities.

IoT connectivity covers a large and often unfamiliar attack surface, and IoT devices and applications have large amounts of personal, operational, and company data. Therefore, IoT security experts need to pay attention to more than the confidentiality, integrity and availability of these traditional information security requirements. Internet of Things cyber security experts are certainly worried about data leaks and other cyber attacks.
The purpose of this special issue is to convene researchers from different fields to focus on understanding the attack threats faced by IoT devices and corresponding security strategies, and to design innovative solutions with the help of the most advanced related technologies.

#### Topics of Interest

Technical scope of this special issue includes, but is not limited to:

- A hardware-based root of trust
- Multi-source IoT data integrity verification in public cloud
- Reflect the status of the IoT available in the context of the spread of malicious programs
